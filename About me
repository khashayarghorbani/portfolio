About me
My name is Khashayar. It’s a name of a king back in 520BC in Iran which means brave and kind
and if you search it on Urban Dictionary it tells you that Khashayar is the best friend anyone could ask for.
Anyways if I want to describe myself I can say that I’m funny, ambitious but also a thinker and creative.
I grew up in Iran and when I was 19 , my family decided to move out to canada. I live in Vancouver at the moment .
I’m happy about this actually because in Canada there are a lot of opportunities for me to improve my skills  and abilities. 
As a hobby I like swimming (I wanted to be like Michael Phelps when I was a kid), and watching movies. 
My biggest dream is to become a filmmaker or become a great actor.
On the other hand, I like to learn how computers work so that in the future I can make my own computer device with a processor
that I’ll build.

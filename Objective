To achieve my main objective which is to be an IT specialist, I have some followings:
1. Obtaining my diploma of System Programming at ITD Canada.
2. Take extra advance courses at lynda relating to my program.
3. Get familiar with IT jobs and the environment. 
4. Getting a job relating to my studies and gain some experience.
5.  Update my knowledge about new gadgets and technologies relating to computer.
6. Become an IT Specialist.
These are the basic steps that I should follow to achieve my objective but there are a lot of small objectives coincide with them. 
The reason why I choose IT is because we are living in the modern world and I like to keep up with it. 
Also when I was a kid, I grew up with computers and I enjoy working with it.
